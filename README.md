Created a Python Code that collects data from a free NewsAPI source and generates Haikus from the articles and headlines
Then used the Webhook librarie to connect to a Discord Webhook server and publish the Haiku requests on the Channel
Work outstanding is to automate the project2.py file into a linux OS using cronjob and schedule the time the Haikus will be posted (suggesting at least twice a day)

### Please Note!!!!!!!!! ###
## IGNORE THE file: Project.py as it stopped working ##
### Only schedule file: project2.py which was tested and is a success ###
